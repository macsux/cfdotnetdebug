# Debugging .NET apps on Cloud Foundry

### These instructions are legacy - use the following guide going forward: https://dotnet-cookbook.cfapps.io/core/remote-debug/

The following is a guide on how to debug .NET Core applications on Cloud Foundry Linux containers from Visual Studio.

1. Download the package from the [releases page](https://github.com/macsux/cfdotnetdebug/releases)
2. Publish your app with debug symbols `dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.0 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64 -c Debug -o publish`
3. Extract the downloaded zip into your `publish\clrdbg` folder
4. `cf push` the app from publish folder
5. Create `launch.xml` file as following:
```xml
<PipeLaunchOptions xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vstudio/MDDDebuggerOptions/2014"
                   PipePath="cf.exe" 
                   PipeArguments="ssh YOUR_APP_NAME -command &quot;~/app/clrdbg/clrdbg --interpreter=mi&quot;"
                   TargetArchitecture="x64" 
                   MIMode="clrdbg" 
                   ProcessId="41">
  <LaunchCompleteCommand>None</LaunchCompleteCommand>
</PipeLaunchOptions>
```
Make sure to adjust PipeArguments

6. Run the following command and record PID of your app
```
> cf ssh YOUR_APP_NAME --command "ps -d"
```
7. Replace the value of `ProcessId` in `launch.xml` with PID for your app
8. From Visual Studio, open Command window (View > Other Windows > Command Window)
9. Run the following in VS Command Window
```
> Debug.MIDebugLaunch /Executable:dotnet /OptionsFile:"C:\FULL_PATH\launch.xml"
```

We should now be debugging

:warning: After you detach, the remote debugger terminates the process which will restart the container.
